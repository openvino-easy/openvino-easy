## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-20

### Added

**Core Features:**

- Rate limiting and input validation

### Technical Details

**Architecture:**
- Clean abstraction layer over OpenVINO runtime
- Extensible plugin system for model formats
- Device-agnostic inference pipeline
- Efficient memory management
- Thread-safe operation

**Performance:**
- Model compilation caching
- Dynamic batching support
- Memory pool optimization
- NUMA-aware CPU scheduling
- GPU memory management
- NPU power optimization

**Quality Assurance:**
- 90+ unit and integration tests
- Multi-platform testing (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Hardware compatibility testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Memory leak detection
- Code coverage reporting

**Dependencies:**
- OpenVINO 2025.2+
- Python 3.8-3.12 support
- NumPy for array operations
- Requests for model downloading
- Optional: librosa (audio), transformers (tokenization)

### Known Limitations

**Model Format Support:**
- PyTorch models require conversion to ONNX
- Some TensorFlow models need preprocessing
- Quantized models may need specific OpenVINO versions

**Hardware Support:**
- NPU requires Intel Arc A-Series or Core Ultra processors
- GPU acceleration needs Intel graphics drivers
- Optimal performance on Intel hardware

**Platform Considerations:**
- Windows: Full feature support
- Linux: Full feature support
- macOS: CPU inference only (no GPU/NPU acceleration)

### Migration Guide

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. Future versions will include migration guides for breaking changes.

### Security

**Security Measures:**
- Input validation for all user inputs
- Safe model loading with format verification
- No execution of untrusted code
- Secure model downloading with checksum verification
- Protection against path traversal attacks
